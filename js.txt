
From Higher Performance Javascript:

IE 8, Firefox 3.5, Safari 4 and Chrome 2 all allow parallel js downloads.

Keeping the script tags as close to the bottomof the body tag as possible, is the Yahoo exceptional
performance team's first rule about Javascript: put scripts at the bottom

Steve Souders recommendation:
	Never keep an inline script after a <link> tag for this reason.

Downloading one single 100 kb file will be faster than downloading four 25 kb files.

using deferred scripts

HTML 4 defines 

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/scripts.html#adef-defer

defer attribute in <script>

when set, this boolean attribute provides a hint to the user agent that the script is not going to 
generate any document content(e.g., no "document.write" in javascript) and thus, the user agent
can continue parsing and rendering

defer is supported by IE 4+, FF 3.5+

Any <script> element marked with defer will not execute until after the DOM has been completely loaded.
This holds true for inline scripts as well as external script files.
